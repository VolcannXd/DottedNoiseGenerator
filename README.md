# DottedNoiseGenerator

## What is a dotted noise ?
A dotted noise generator is simply a way of generating noise wich I come up with. A dotted noise algorithm simply place points at random positions and calculate for each pixels the distance between these and the pixel. Then, the pixel's brightness is calculated from the distance.

## How to use the generator
Simply specify parameters in the GUI and click 'generate'. Then, save your favorites parameters by clicking File > Save. You can also save the image by clicking Image > Save..
